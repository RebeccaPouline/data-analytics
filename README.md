# Telecommunication Project

## Description
This repository contains case studies that I have worked on as part of my education as a data analyst. The purpose is to demonstrate my skills in data collection, cleansing, analysis, and visualization.

## Machine Learning Techniques: Clustering and Churn Analysis 
Clustering Analysis for Understanding Customer Behavior: Machine learning models are used to conduct clustering analysis, which identifies distinct groups of customers in telecom data. These groups are formed based on various factors, such as income and how long customers have been with their subscription, and the analysis also takes into account demographic details. Insights from this clustering process help in creating specific strategies for keeping customers and designing loyalty programs that address the distinct needs of each group.

Cost-Focused Churn Analysis: Logistic regression is utilized to create a strategy focused on minimizing costs when dealing with customer churn. Setting an optimal threshold helps reduce the expenses linked to incorrect predictions about customers leaving or stayingâ€”important considerations in managing and retaining customers. In this case, greater costs are assigned to missing a churn (false negatives) than to wrongly predicting churn (false positives), indicating that getting a customer back costs more than keeping them.

The findings from these analyses aim to support a strategy that is informed by data, flexible, and focused on the customer, enabling companies to adapt based on what they continuously learn about customer preferences and behavior. To see the detailed code and methods used, please explore this repository.
